# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

This project was a huge learning curve for me. Definitely enjoyed it challenging me to become more familiar with BEM, Flexbox, iframe, margins, paddings, etc.

It is my goal to become better at building such projects through muscle memory and pratice.
